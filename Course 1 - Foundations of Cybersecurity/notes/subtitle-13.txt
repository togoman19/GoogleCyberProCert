In an organization, plans
are put in place to protect against a variety of threats,
risks, and vulnerabilities. However, the requirements
used to protect organizations and
people often overlap. Because of this, organizations
use security frameworks as a starting point to create their own security
policies and processes. Let's start by quickly
reviewing what frameworks are. Security frameworks are
guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy, such as social engineering
attacks and ransomware. Security involves more than
just the virtual space. It also includes the physical, which is why many
organizations have plans to maintain safety
in the work environment. For example, access
to a building may require using a
key card or badge. Other security
frameworks provide guidance for how to prevent, detect, and respond
to security breaches. This is particularly important when trying to protect
an organization from social engineering attacks like phishing that target
their employees. Remember, people are the
biggest threat to security. So frameworks can be used to
create plans that increase employee awareness and
educate them about how they can protect
the organization, their co-workers,
and themselves. Educating employees about
existing security challenges is essential for minimizing the
possibility of a breach. Providing employee
training about how to recognize red flags, or
potential threats, is essential, along with
having plans in place to quickly report and
address security issues. As an analyst, it will be important for you
to understand and implement the plans
your organization has in place to keep
the organization, its employees, and
the people it serves safe from social
engineering attacks, breaches, and other harmful
security incidents. Coming up, we'll review and discuss security
controls, which are used alongside frameworks to achieve an organization's
security goals.
